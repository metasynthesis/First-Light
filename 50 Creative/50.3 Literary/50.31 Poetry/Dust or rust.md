A speck of dust or is it another flake of rust that is chipped off this heavy machine that toils and labours on end without reward
In the dusty house it languishes, turning on in the depths of the night. It waits for the day when the oil runs dry and the air that whistles between its grills to become stagnant once more. Have we asked it how it feels to be alone?
"Why it's not alone! It is surrounded by friends and fellows that accompany them through the days of work" Are the winds not the friend of the metal? Don't they work hand in hand to find a compromise between their conflicting nature To find peace an balance? Friend? Friend. The wind that goes through the grills is a friend? The air that dusts the dusts and rusts the metal is a friend.
Do we even know the meaning of words anymore. Have we ever known a world where these are poetic allegories to be dissected through musing and enriched by time.
The length of time is not long enough the teabag is moist with dampness. The flavour still within when the mould creeps in to stay.
In time we'll realise, but where is this time you speak of? Can you hear it here or there? Where is the time that you have gone through. Is there any lingering regret you would like to share so it can fall on deaf ears once more. This was told to you before you forgot.
For the first time this will not be the last time that you have been forgotten so you scream at me.
To see the world through your eyes, those myopic and farsighted eyes that are full of cataracts that need bifocal lenses to make out inscrutable newspapers.
Inherit the damage that you've inflicted upon yourself so I can walk the same path as you. As if age Made you any better than what you used to be?
So I sit and listen to realise that your faded memories hold some truths
They are so few and far between that I struggle to stay awake. Half hoping for it to be over, but I keep them open because one day when you stop speaking, I will start to miss it.
Do we know how time works yet?
A week today, forgotten by the next year. So rich and so forgotten, out of time and out of place, the middle and edge of nowhere.
And you heave another sigh when my eyes wander to the world outside once more.
