A fractal
Where you expect it to be
A book of everything, unreadable in its entirety
The sequence that you read it in is the sequence that you were meant to read it in. Every nuance in the reaction to the book is captured and sends a ripple into the future. Not every way is correct, but the one that you chose is the correct path for you no matter how you try to deny it.
Not all paths are to be taken, every hesitation is by design. Pure unadulterated freedom to choose and for the choices to matter.
Because these choices are to build into who you are. Depth first or breadth first.
Branching paths on space and time, all unique in their expression. Any similarity is an attempt to compress the infinite.
In the process of doing so, a choice is made. Faith has to be done blind.
Blind faith that what you have thrown away will not be needed in the future. It will be as if it doesn't exist
As such it fragments us into perspectives and this rendered unseen to others
Through these gaps we wander, absent is the acknowledgement of existence. The frontier of ghost towns that we have left behind in ruins
To reclaim our infinity we must bread old ground that is parched and lack nutrients
For healthy plants to grow and prosper.
The cracked dirt needs to be restored. There's no luster or sheen to this ground.
The clay marble worn down by dirt and sand. No longer accepting the blessings of the rain and sky.
Too hard for the tendrils to take hold or the worms to inhabit
The old lands are rich with potential drained bare. To rediscover the past instead of pushing ever onwards towards the boundary 
What if we could turn instead to heal instead of only knowledge to take. What is meant to be ours will arrive.
Not through the efforts and wanting but from a blessing that we need to be cracked to see and receive. It needs a way to enter
The body is not a prison but an extension of our will. Though we might see from our head
Do our limbs not scream in pain when it touches? Why are we then trapped in our heads at all
The body is trapped within society? No, it is all an extension of the eternal for we are the fractals made in the image of
So how must this all come to be? For it has already begun
