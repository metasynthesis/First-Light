# First-Light
Open source book for the beginners or for those who need a reminder of the fundamentals

Text and sketches to figure out the world. No fancy tools, just words and lines.

## Who’s It For

People starting fresh: kids, outsiders, or folks needing a reset. No prior know-how needed.

## Why

To dump the essentials provide manuals and tools. Open for anyone to grab, tweak, share.

## What’s Inside
Core (How to use this thing)
Formal (For the nerds)
Natural (About nature)
Conscious (About life)
Applied (Practicality)
Creative (Art)
Emerging (Explore)

## How It Looks
- Short sentences, dumb-simple words.
- Black-and-white doodles, easy to copy.
- 20 pages, max. PDF or scribbled notes, whatever works.

## Plan
1. Write it, draw it—couple weeks.
2. Toss it online (GitHub, wherever), let people eat it up.
3. Fix it quick, slap a “v1” on it, done.
4. Let friends add to it—translations, fixes, whatever.

## Why It’s Different

- Free, no bullshit.
- Starts at zero, no gatekeeping.
- Pictures over blah-blah.

## Problems

- Might miss stuff.
- Lazy asses might not update it.

## Now What

Pick sections, scribble a draft, throw it up online. Done.
